## Add-on

The Custom Formulas Add-on uses the SpreadsheetApp service to create a menu and to show a context related help window of the formula selected.In this process, no user information is collected, stored or used otherwise. Authentification of the Add-on is soly based on this use-case and scope.

## Formulas

The Custom Formulas themselves are constructed in such a way that they only use pure Google Apps Script JavaScript. Even services that do not require authentication are omitted, to avoid user data being stored elsewhere.
