The `SQL` custom formula combines the [`ARRAYFORMULA`][1], [`INDEX`][2] and [`SORT`][4] formula into one, which makes 
it very versatile in returning an sorted and inarray (matrix). More information can be found on the [help][3] page 
of the `MATRIX` formula, which also has a screencastify video available.

## Syntax

    SQLINNERJOIN(range1, pk1, range2, pk2[, opt_header]) {
 
## Usage

- `SQLCROSSJOIN(A2:B8,2,A11:B15,1,true)`
Outputs the cross join, in which the second column of range1 acts as the primairy key. The first column of range2 must be used as the primairy key.
