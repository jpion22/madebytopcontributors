## Add-on

The Custom Formulas Add-on uses the class [SpreadsheetApp][1] to create a menu and the class [HtmlService][2] to show a context related help window of the formula selected. In this process, no user information is collected, stored or used otherwise. In order to inform you about Add-on updates, we use the class [PropertiesService][3] to compare user vs. script values upon opening of the document to show a dialogue of what's new.  
Furthermore, the UTILITIES formulas uses the class [SpreadsheetApp][1] to retrieve specific user spreadsheet information. In this process, no user information is collected, stored or used otherwise. Authentication of the Add-on is solely based on this use-case and scope.

## Formulas

The Custom Formulas themselves are constructed in such a way that they only use pure  
Google Apps Script JavaScript. Even services that do not require authentication  
are omitted, to avoid user data being stored elsewhere.
